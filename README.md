# Physics and Numerical Calculation Laboratory Website

This project is a web design and implementation for the **Physics Laboratory** and **Numerical Calculation Laboratory** at Qom University. It was developed during my bachelor's degree at the Informatics Center of Qom University(2019). The website integrates both front-end and back-end technologies and is installed on WordPress as the content management system (CMS).

## Technologies Used

### Front-end:
- **HTML**: Structuring the websiteâ€™s content.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the website.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side functionality and interactivity.

### Back-end:
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language used for WordPress theme and plugin development.

### CMS:
- **WordPress**: The website is built using WordPress, an open-source CMS.
